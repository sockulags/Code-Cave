# The Code Cave: A Repository Of Knowledge
The most difficult part with coming up with project ideas is not just what, but also why. If I create something I want it to something of use. This project is a representation of me as a person. I don't like to re-invent the wheel, so if I have written a piece of code before, Id rather copy it as a snippet the next time. If I have a gone through a process of initializing something new for me, I could you document that process in my own words - it will probably better, for me, than any other documentation page on the web.
